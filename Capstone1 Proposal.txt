Cooking/Recipe App


STEP 1


* Create a website that allows users to search for specific recipes which includes ingredient lists, and cooking steps. Cooking time, nutritional value


* Ability to search recipes by country(“cuisine”), dietary restrictions


* Could included wine pairing suggestions






Step 2


Create a user profile to save favorite recipes for easy access. User passwords would be encrypted with bcrypt

* Offer seasonal dish suggestions to user 




Requests a random(popular) food that has the tag of the season in it(season would be a variable based off of the date)
